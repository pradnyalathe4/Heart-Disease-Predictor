**Heart Disease Prediction System
**
An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the risk of heart disease using patient health parameters.
The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data handling, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction through a web interface.

This project was developed as part of an internship program to gain hands-on experience with industry-oriented Machine Learning applications.

**Problem Statement
**
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and preventive care.

The objective of this project is to:

Analyze patient health data

Train a machine learning model

Predict whether a person is at high risk or low risk of heart disease

Display prediction results with confidence score

**Project Objectives
**
